Virtual Radio module for Eurorack 

A digital way to simulate radio-powered compositions by John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Don Buchla's voltage-controlled radio experiments. 

It uses a teensy3.1 to play files from a SD card to simulate a voltage controlled AM/FM/Shortwave/Time Travel radio. 

October 2014: Very early prototyping

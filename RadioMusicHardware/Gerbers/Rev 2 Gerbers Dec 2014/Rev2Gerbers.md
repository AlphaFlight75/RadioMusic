##Rev 2 Gerbers  

These gerbers are prepared to Seeed Studio specs   

Things to check  
- The panel PCB includes a cutout for the SD card - this is marked in the Outline layer (.OUT), and also in the milling layer (.GML)   
- On the panel, ask your PCB house not to put their serial number on top silkscreen (the front of the panel)  

The Eagle archive is here as a snapshot of the Eagle files these PCBs were made from. The main eagle files in the repository are constantly updating

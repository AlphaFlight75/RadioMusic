New Stuff

Banks / Files
-------------

At the moment its 16 banks of 64 files because of memory limitations. Optimising may increase this at some point.

Bank switching is controlled by holding down the RESET button. After 1 second the top leds will flash then every 600 milliseconds it will change to the next bank with the bank number displayed as binary in the top leds.

Pitch Control
-------------

add 'pitchMode=1' to the config.

In pitchMode any retrigger (either button or RESET input) will play the file from the start.

In pitch mode there are also noteRange=INT and quantizeNote=0/1 options.

Wav Files 
---------

There is a new setting 'anyAudioFiles=1' which will read pretty much any 16 and 24 bit files.

BUT this will turn off crossfading so any channel changes are hard cuts.

If the setting is not in the file or is 0 then it will read .raw files and only those .wav files 
that are 44k 16bit mono.

Tip Top Format
--------------

If it finds 'config.txt' in the root of the card then it will scan for all
extensionless files in the root and assume they are 24/96 tip top format files.

If there are more than 64 files they will be spread across banks.

At the moment this mode has looping turned off and pitch mode turned on. The settings file will not affect these options.
